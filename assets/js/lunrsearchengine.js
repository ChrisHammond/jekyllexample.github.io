    "body": "2024/06/21 - Introduction: In the ever-evolving world of SEO and web development, structured content has become a cornerstone for creating high-performing, search-engine-friendly websites. For those who use static site generators like Jekyll, leveraging structured content can significantly enhance your site’s visibility and usability. In this blog post, we’ll explore the benefits of using structured content with Jekyll, specifically focusing on the JekyllExample. com template/repo. What is Structured Content?: Structured content is a way of organizing information on your website so that it is easily understood by search engines and other web services. This is often achieved using schema markup (or structured data), which provides context to your content, making it more accessible and indexable. Common types of structured data include information about articles, events, products, and reviews, among others. Benefits of Structured Content: Improved SEO: One of the primary benefits of structured content is its impact on SEO. By adding schema markup to your Jekyll site, you provide search engines with detailed information about your content. This can result in better indexing and higher rankings, as search engines can more accurately understand and present your content to users. Enhanced Rich Snippets: Structured data can enhance the appearance of your site in search results by generating rich snippets. These are enhanced listings that show additional information, such as ratings, authors, and dates, directly in the search results. Rich snippets can improve your click-through rates by making your listings more attractive and informative. Better Content Organization: Using structured content helps you maintain a consistent and organized format for your information. This is particularly useful for larger websites with diverse content types. It ensures that each piece of content follows a set structure, making it easier to manage and update. Improved Accessibility: Structured content can also improve the accessibility of your site. By providing clear, well-defined data structures, you make it easier for assistive technologies, like screen readers, to interpret and present your content to users with disabilities. Using the JekyllExample. com Template: The JekyllExample. com template/repo is an excellent starting point for those looking to implement structured content on a Jekyll-based website. This template comes with built-in support for structured data, specifically using the BlogPosting schema type. If your site requires a different content type, such as Article, you can easily modify the schema type to fit your needs. Conclusion: Integrating structured content into your Jekyll site using the JekyllExample. com template can significantly enhance your site’s SEO, user experience, and accessibility. By providing clear, organized data to search engines and assistive technologies, you make your content more discoverable and user-friendly. Start leveraging the power of structured content today and watch your Jekyll site soar in the search rankings. "

    "body": "2023/02/01 - This post is still a work in progress as of 5/18/2024: The goal for this blog post is to provide easy instructions for installing Jekyll. If you follow these steps, you should be able to create a new Jekyll web site utilizing GitHub and GitHub Pages to host your repository and web site. We will walk you through the process of cloning the repository, making some changes to the site to configure it to be your own, and then ultimately getting your website published using your own custom domain name. A couple of assumptions to start:  You have a GitHub account created.  You have already purchased a custom domain name to use (you can bypass this and create a site using SITENAME. github. io) You have Git tools installed (if you’re using Windows, use Git For Windows) You have Visual Studio Code installed, or some other text editor that you’re comfortable with. Precursor: This page is a work in progress, if you find something missing or wrong, let me know! You can create an issue on the GitHub repo! Instructions:  Create a new Organization on GitHub     A free organization account will be sufficient. For our example organization, we will used JekyllExampleWeb (JekyllExample was already taken).    Creating a new organization for each custom domain name you are going to use makes it easier to setup and manage multiple sites. You theoretically could get by with one Organization or just multiple projects under your user account, but I find it easier to manage multiple sites this way.     Create a new repository based off the JekyllExample repository     While logged into GitHub, you should see a button that says “Use this template” next to the Code button in the JekyllExample repo, creating on the Use this template button will allow you to create a fork that is disconnected from the original repo and doesn’t bring over all the change history.    Be sure to check the “Include all branches” option when doing this, otherwise MAIN won’t come over and the workflow won’t work.     Rename the repository to match the domain name that you want to use for GitHub Pages     As soon as you fork the repository, you can rename it. You will want to rename it to match the domain name that you want to use for GitHub Pages, for example we use jekyllexample. com, so the repository is jekyllexample. github. io.     Clone the repository to your local machine for editing     You can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command, (assuming you have Git installed, start up Git Bash and then navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository to)    1 git clone https://github. com/ORGANIZATION/SITENAME. github. io. git          Where SITENAME is the name of your repository that you modified in Step 3.     Open the repository in Visual Studio Code     You can open the repository in Visual Studio Code using the following command:    1 code SITENAME. github. io          Where SITENAME is the name of your repository that you modified in Step 3.     Navigate to the Repository Settings in GitHub     Navigate to the Actions/General Settings         Under Workflow Permissions be sure to choose “Read and write permissions” for the Actions workflow to be able to push changes to the repository. (If you are unable to set this, try changing it at the Organization level first, then this individual repo)           Change the _config. yml file     This file has a number of variables for options for your site, such as Title, Description, Author, etc. You will want to customize these to start to brand and name your site.    If you’re using Google Analytics you can configure the MEASUREMENT ID here as well.     Edit the CNAME file in the root of the repository to match your custom domain name     If you’re not using a custom domain name, you can delete this file.     Commit your changes to the GitHub repository and push them.   123 git add . git commit -m  Some updated comment about the commit here  git push       You may be prompted to configure your GitHub credentials at this point, here’s an approach on how to do that.     Configure the repository settings for GitHub Pages and Workflow to allow for deployment     In the GitHub Repository Settings, you will want to configure the following:         Under the GitHub Settings find the GitHub Pages section     Under Source choose “Deploy from a branch”     Under Branch choose “main” and “/(root)”           Configure your DNS for your domain to point to GitHub pages     You will need to do this before step 10 so that GitHub can verify and find your custom domain name configured properly.    You basically need to setup A records for your domain name that point to the following IP addresses:         185. 199. 108. 153     185. 199. 109. 153     185. 199. 110. 153     185. 199. 111. 153              I use CloudFlare for my domains, so the DNS entries are configured as follows:       You would replace jekyllexample. com with your domain in your DNS settings.     Configure your custom Domain Name     Under the GitHub Settings find the GitHub Pages section   Under Custom Domain, enter your custom domain name (ex: jekyllexample. com)    Navigate to the Actions tab in the GitHub interface     You should see your commit that you pushed in step 8, and you should see a workflow that is running (or has ran).    After that you should see a second action that is running (or has ran) something like “pages build and deployment”   If both of those actions have completed successfully, you should be able to navigate to your custom domain name and see your site.     Next steps! Edit the blog posts in the _posts folder, or delete them and create your own posts.      The easiest way to create a new post is to simply copy and paste one of the existing posts         Rename the file to match the date and title of your post     Edit the file to change the content/title and importantly be sure to update the published date to the dat you want the post to be.      Commit and push your changes to GitHub and you should see your new post on your site after the workflow completes.           "
